# CitiBike in Des Moines Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to look over the data for a month of citibike rides in New York City to get an idea of what to expect if the bikes were deployed in Des Moines. While Des Moines is a very different city than NYC, we can expect many of the same trends to carry over to the new location. The data was supplied in the form of a .csv, which contained detailed information about each ride that month (i.e., trip duration, start time, end time, various bits of information about the user, location, etc.). We then uploaded the data into Tableau, where it could be sorted through very easily since the data was already "clean." The different worksheets were eventually combined into a Tableau Story that could be presented to stakeholders who would be interested in adding citibikes in the new location.
